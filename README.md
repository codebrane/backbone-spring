Backbone Spring
===============
Backbone/Marionette application based on the book:

[Backone Marionette, A Gentle Introduction](https://leanpub.com/marionette-gentle-introduction)

by [David Sulc](http://davidsulc.com/)

It's the same application but with a different domain model, Courses instead of Contacts.
Also, the local storage chapter has been replaced by a Spring 4 web application for
testing model fetch and save functionality across the network.
